## 2. Course Description and Learning Objectives
Programming for Cognitive Science has three primary learning objectives: 
> - to learn what computer programming is, and what one can accomplish using computer programs
> - to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language, including its syntax and proper programming technique and style
> - to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about cognitive science.

## 3. Course Requirements and Grading
**Grading Scale**<br>
\- A+   97-100<br>
\- A    93-97<br>
\- A-   90-93<br>
\- B+   87-90<br>
\- B    83-87<br>
\- B-   80-83<br>
\- C+   77-80<br>
\- C    73-77<br>
\- C-   70-73<br>

\- D    63-67<br>
\- D-   60-63<br>
\- F    Below 60<br>

**Grade Components**<br>
\- Participation: 10%<br>
\- Group Lab Work: 20%<br>
\- Homework: 40%<br>
\- Final Project: 30%<br>

**Participation:**<br>
Participation is graded in terms of attendance and asking questions in class. 
Much of the learning in class comes through hands on activity and practice. 
If you don’t come you won’t get that experience. Thus, the class’s attendance policy is 
that you should come to class, and that failing to do so will directly affect your grade. 
Each week is worth 5 points. You get 4 just for showing up, and you get the other point for 
asking at least one question in class.

**Group Lab Work:**<br>
Each week we will be spending a considerable portion of our lab time working on various 
exercises and projects. Your group must submit your work for the lab period at the end of class. 
This will be graded based on effort. If your group appear to have made a good effort at the week’s 
activities, you get the points. If you don’t try, or if you don’t come to class, you don’t get the points.

**Homework:**<br>
Homework will be posted to the course Github website each week by 10am on Tuesday morning, 
and must be completed and turned in by the following Monday at 11:59pm. Homework MUST be turned 
in by submitting it to your TA via the course website. Homework will be docked 10% for day it is late.

**Final Project:**<br>
The final project will involve creating a Python program that is an extension of some of the lab group work activities. 
We will discuss the details later. By the end of Week 10, your group must submit a project proposal that states a 
research question, multiple hypotheses, and how your program, analysis, or simulation will test those hypotheses. 
At the end of the quarter, you will turn in your code and a brief project report, which describes your results.
Your group will then present your project to the class during the final exam period.
For the project, you may work alone or in a group. The bigger the group, the higher the expectations for your project.
As a part of the project proposal, each group must clearly assign roles, making sure each person is contributing to 
different aspects of the project. For example, one person cannot just be in charge of the presentation, without doing 
any coding!

## 4. Attendance Policy
As noted above, attendance is built into the class in terms of your participation grade,
 and the lab assignments. These elements combine to make up 40% of your grade, 
 and so consistent absence from class will be very detrimental. This is a class with considerable 
 in class work and participation, and so if attendance will be difficult for you, it is recommended 
 you wait and take the course at a time you will be able to attend.

## 5. Academic Integrity Policy
This class will take the University’s Academic Integrity policy very seriously. 
Cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. 
The University of Illinois has the responsibility for maintaining academic integrity so as to protect 
the quality of education and research on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity. 
It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, 
from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such 
infractions. It is also a responsibility of the student to know and understand what constitutes academic 
integrity infractions. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. The University’s official statement of a student’s 
responsibilities can be found here: http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html
More information about the University’s academic integrity policy, and what constitutes an infraction, 
can be found here: http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/.

## 6. Accomodation Policy
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, 
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and 
Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, 
call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website (https://www.disability.illinois.edu). 
If you are concerned you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, 
there are academic screening appointments available on campus that can help diagnosis a previously 
undiagnosed disability by visiting the DRES website and selecting “Sign-Up for an Academic Screening” 
at the bottom of the page.”
