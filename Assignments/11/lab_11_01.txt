In this week's lab, we are introducing two things:
    1) the basics of supervised machine learning
    2) how to create a complex python project with multiple code files

Lab Activities and Questions

1. Open the classify.py program. 

Make sure that the FILE_NAME parameter is set to data/data1.csv, and that all other parameters are left how I had them.

In the main function, make sure that every line EXCEPT 49 is commented out. This creates an instance of the dataset by
loading the data1.csv file. Take a look at the output that prints out. Discuss with your group to make sure that you
all understand everything being printed. Then, change the FILE_NAME to data/data2.csv, and then to data/data3.csv.
What changes?

2. Uncomment the line 51 and rerun the program. What is this command doing? What prints out? Feel free to look at the
code to see if that helps you understand it.

3. Uncomment line 53 and rerun the program. What is this line doing? Try changing the values of F1 and F2 to different
    numbers. What do you observe? Uncomment line 54 and run the program. Try changing F_INDEX to different numbers and
    observe the difference. What do you find?

4. Using these two plots for data3.csv, what do you conclude about how easy it would be to use these features to
    correctly classify the groups of animals into their correct category?

5. Change NORMALIZE_DATA to True and try rerunning the program. What is this doing to the data? Feel free to figure
    this out by looking at the data or by looking at the code. How might this affect the ability to correctly categorize
    the animals?

6. Uncomment out lines 57-59 and rerun the program. Explain what this is doing, and what you are observing in the
printed output.

7. Try changing the value of MIN_MAX_KNN and of TRAINING PROPORTION. How do different values affect how the knn
    classification program works?
