'''
    you can think of python programs as falling into two categories:
    1) short simple "scripts" that are designed to quickly accomplish some task
    2) longer "programs" that are doing a lot of complex things. If you are writing programs, it is important to keep
        them organized for all kinds of reasons.
        - they are easier to read
        - they are easier to debug
        - they are easier to share and work on collaboratively
        - they are easier to remember what the hell you were doing when you pick up a script later
        - most importantly, functions that are well defined, meaning they do one and only one thing, make it really
            easy for you to take a function you made in some earlier program and stick them in a new one, saving you
            lots of time


    big programs are usually organized in the following way:
    a "main" function, that calls a bunch of other functions.
    edit the code below that counts the words in a string that you typed
'''

# def get_input(??????):  # an input argument goes here
     # create a line that gets an input string
     # create a line that returns the input string back to the main function

# def get_unique_word_list(???????): # an input argument goes here
     # add the code that creates a list of the unique words in the string
     # return the new list back to the main function

# def count_words(???????): # input arguments
     # add the code that counts how many times each unique word occurs in the input string, adding those values to a list
     # return this list back to the main program

# def print_results(??????): # input arguments
     # add code that prints out each word and each frequency, on its own line, like this:
     # dog: 2
     # cat: 1
     # shoe: 2

# def main():
#     get_input() # edit so it passes and receives appropriate variables
#     get_unique_word_list() # edit so it passes and receives appropriate variables
#     count_words() # edit so it passes and receives appropriate variables
#     print_results() # edit so it passes and receives appropriate variables
#
# main()
