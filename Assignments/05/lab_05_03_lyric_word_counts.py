Paste in your code from last week

0) finish it, if you did not get it done last week

1) add a line to the main() function so that the program takes an input argument (using sys.argv), and stores it in the
variable "lyrics_path". pass that variable to the "get_song_lists" function

2) change the "get_song_lists" function so that, instead of hard-coding the artist names and song title names,
these are figured out automatically by having python look inside the directories that is stored in "lyrics_path". Hint,
you will need to use functions from the os module to do this.
